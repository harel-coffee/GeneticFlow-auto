# Folder


[Award_Authors] :
It contains the top authors (ranked by H-index) information for each field. And we infer award recipients from 200 candidate authors from a specific field, including 50 true awardees (awardee_*.csv) and 150 other authors (non_awardee_*.csv).

[GeneticFlow_Graphs] :
It contains initial geneticFlow graphs of authors.

[Bibliographic_Networks] :
It contains bibliographic networks of authors.

[Award_Inference_Experiment] :
It contains award inference experiment.



# Introduction


The dataset includes 5 sub-fields of computer science (CS) defined in MAG plus the NLP field (ARC data). These fields are selected due to the higher number of award recipients than the other sub-fields of CS, thus alleviates the imbalanced-data issue for the inference task. We only consider the highest-class technical achievement/innovation awards in each field, plus the title of ACM fellow and Turing award as general awards in CS.
