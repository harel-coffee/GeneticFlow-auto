[Advisor-advisee_Relationship_Detection] : 
We provide a python file, which introduces our algorithm for advisor-advisee detection task.

[Inference_of_Extend-type_Citations] :  
Within this folder, extra-trees classifier are trained with labeled data, for the detection task of extend-type citations.

[Award_Inference_Task] : 
Based on award author information, we conduct award inference experiments, using GNN model, which embed the GeneticFlow graph (or other alternative graphs) and node/edge relevancy into vector representation for downstream academic impact evaluation tasks.
